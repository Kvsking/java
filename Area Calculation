Sheela has three things in her bag. She wants to compute the area of 3 things but 3 things are in different shapes. The three things are in square shape, rectangular shape, and circular shape respectively. Write a program to help Sheela to calculate the area of different shapes. 
Input format: 
First input: a side of a square in integer 
Second input: length of a rectangle in integer 
Third input: breadth of a rectangle in integer 
Fourth input: radius of a circle in float 
Output format: 
The first output should be the area of a square in integer 
The second output should be the area of a rectangle in integer 
The third output should be the area of a circle in float with 2 decimal places
Sample Input:

code:👍
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Area
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
      Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
      int a=sc.nextInt();
      int b=sc.nextInt();
      int c=sc.nextInt();
      float d=sc.nextFloat();
      int e=a*a;
      int f=b*c;
      double h=d*d*3.14;
      System.out.println(e);
      System.out.println(f);
      System.out.printf("%.2f\n",h);
      
      }
